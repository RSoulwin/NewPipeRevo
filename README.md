# NewPipeRevo
 NewPipe Revo does not use any Google framework libraries, nor the YouTube API. Websites are only parsed to fetch required info, so this app can be used on devices without Google services installed. Also, you don't need a YouTube account to use NewPipe, which is copylefted libre software.
